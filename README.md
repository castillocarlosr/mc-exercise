Merge conflicts are easy to create when multitple people work on the same section of a file.  Branching helps but still creates a conflict.  
What I learned is that everyone should agree ahead of time and branch from the master.  Never work on the master.  Branch often.  And ONLY work on your section.
Slack if you want to touch someone else's section and make sure they know before you start.  Plan!
